#Python comparison operators can also be used on strings. String a is smaller than string b if it comes alphabetically before b. Notice however that the comparison is only reliable if

#the characters compared are of the same case, i.e. both UPPERCASE or both lowercase
#only the standard English alphabet of a to z, or A to Z, is used.

#Please write a program which asks the user for two words. The program should then print out whichever of the two comes alphabetically last.

#You can assume all words will be typed in lowercase entirely.

#Some examples of expected behaviour:

#Please type in the 1st word: car
#Please type in the 2nd word: scooter
#scooter comes alphabetically last.

#Please type in the 1st word: zorro
#Please type in the 2nd word: batman
#zorro comes alphabetically last.

#Please type in the 1st word: python
#Please type in the 2nd word: python
#You gave the same word twice.

word = input("Please type in the 1st word:")
word1 = input("Please type in the 2nd word:")

# based on the problem if the word greater than the next word it will print the who is the alphabetically last
if word > word1:
    print(f"{word} comes alphabetically last")
elif word1 > word:
    print(f"{word1} comes alphabetically last")
else:
    print("You gave the same word twice")
